    <h2 class="a">5.Groups of selectors</h2>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual <br>selectors in the list.(Acomma is U+002C) For exmaple, in CSS when several selectors share the same <br>declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the <br>comma.</p>
    <div class="b">
        <p>CSS example: <br> <br>
            In the example, we condense three rules with identical declaraions into one. Thus,<br>
            <br>
            h1 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
            h2 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
            h3 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
            <br>
            is equivalent to:<br>
            h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
        </p>
